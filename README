fixed bugs of login and register.

I have separate index.php and login.php

while index.php is only a form of login, 
and login.php accesses database and deal with login performance.

And the same as register.php and register_process.php

While register.php is only a form, and register_process.php deal with the performance.

Added a new file called error.php , which can deal with all error, hopefully.
